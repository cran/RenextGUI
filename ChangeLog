CHANGES

	o Most global variables now can be set in a new environment
	instead of the global one. This is done by turning the 
	'useGlobalenv' formal to FALSE. A trick is used in order
	to avoid the NOTE with message 'no visible global binding...' 
	during the check. However, the dataset 'Brest' and 'Garonne' 
	still remain in the global env.

	o Some call used partial matching (notably using 'cont'
	in place of 'container'). They were tracked using the 
	R-alpha version check and corrected.
	
	
		CHANGES IN RenextGUI package VERSION 0.9-1
	

CHANGES

	o In the document 'RenextGUIGuide' and in the example
	of the package it is advised to use 'options(warn = 1)'
	before launching the GUI.

	o In the 'RenextGUIGuide' document, a few words were added
	to tell that the GUI does not provide function for event
	analysis. Since 'RenextGuide' is no longer provided as 
	a vignette (with source) but rather as a pdf doc, some
	small changes had to be done in the text.


BUG FIXES

	o There was a bug in the R Dump since it still used the 
	old 'fit.Renouv' function while 'Renouv' must now be used.

	
		CHANGES IN RenextGUI package VERSION 0.9-0
	

CHANGES
	
	o The package now requires Renext >= 1.5 since the
	fit is done using the 'Renouv' function in place	
	of the 'fit.Renouv' function.

	o The vignette warns the user that it may be necessary
	to delete empty results when convergence problems 
	occur.

	o When a dum R file is created it is no longer browsed
	since this created problems under windows. The vignette 
	was changed in consequence.

	

		CHANGES IN RenextGUI package VERSION 0.8-0

BUG FIXES

	o When data were read from a csv file with non-POSIX date
	format (e.g. %d/%m/%Y), the date was not converted to 
	POSIXct, and thus the plot built by clciking on 'Plot'
	in the 'data' tab was misleading.
	

CHANGES
	
	o When a project is selected to be used for a fit, it
	becomes 'locked', i.e. it ca nno longer be edited using
	the widgets of the 'data' tab. These widgets are then 
	disabled and should have a 'grayed' font.

	o The export to ODT files is no longer supported.	
	Consequently the packages 'XML', 'odfWeave' are no longer
	required or suggested.
	
	
		CHANGES IN RenextGUI package VERSION 0.7-1

BUG FIXES

	o In the R dump, the program created contained a
	syntax error in the case where only one historical block
	was given.	
	
	
 		CHANGES IN RenextGUI package VERSION 0.7-0
	
NEW FEATURES 	
	
	o The Csv import wizard now allows the choice of the decimal
	separator; point or comma  as enjoyed by french users.
	
	o New function (still experimental) allowing the "dump"
	of a fit/result as a R program file whith comments.

CHANGES

	o The button of the 'results' frame: 'Plot', ...
	have been reordered.

	o The (non exported) method 'HTML.summary.Renouv'
	now shows the values of the historical data when 
	their number in a block is small enougn (<= 12).
	This change does not yet appears in the 
	'print.summary.Renouv' method since it needs a new
	version of Renext.
	
	
BUG FIXES

	o In the HTML export, the path of the png graph was
	absolute, and thus the directory could not be moved
	elsewhere in the file system. Now it is relative.

	o The copy/paste of results table to the clipboard
	now supresses rownames and rounds the 'period' col.
	to integers (years).
	
	
		CHANGES IN RenextGUI package VERSION 0.6-0
	
NEW FEATURES 	
	
	o New "csv Import Wizard" allowing to import csv files 
	with several options: separator, header, skipped lines,
	... The wizard tries to guess which columns are date,
	numeric or anything else, and should recognize usual
	date formats such as %d/%m/%Y which is popular in France
	
	o It is now possible to use projects with or without
	a 'date'  column. An 'hasDate' flag is used
	internally to code the availability of the date, 
	and the plot of the data will be adapted if no
	date is available.
	
	o HTML export now uses 2 'css' files: screen and printer.

	o It is now possible when two historical datasets are 
	given to use each dataset separately, or to use both 
	at the same time.
	

BUG FIXES

	o Using the "delete" button in either "data" or "fit"
	screens, problems occured, especially when deleting the
	last item. This is now fixed.

	o In this 'ChangeLog', the changes for version 0.5-0
	where attributed to 0.4.7 which will not exist!


	
		CHANGES IN RenextGUI package VERSION 0.5-0
	
	
NEW FEATURES

	i.e. as a directory containing a png graph and an
	"index.html" file.
	

BUG FIXES

	o Indexation problems inthe notebook "results" corrected.

	o Colnames removed in the "paste to clipboard" 
	for results table.

	
	
		CHANGES IN RenextGUI package VERSION 0.4-6
	
			   
CHANGES 		   
	
	o The csv file chosen with "browse" is now validated without
 	clicking on the text edit.

	o With the current 0.44-0 Rforge version of gWidgetstcltk, the
	spinbutton for the threshold now validates even when it
	is maintained with button 1 pressed. 
	
	  	
		CHANGES IN RenextGUI package VERSION 0.4.5

NEW FEATURES 		
			
	o In the 'results' tab of the main window, it is possible
	to copy to the clipboard one of the two tables containing 
	the coefficients and the predictions. This is intendended
	mainly for Windows users since Unix systems do not allow
	writing to the clipboard. This may be used to copy/paste
	in MS best sellers 'Excel' or 'Word'.
	
			   
CHANGES 		   
	
	o The glabel describing the main title 'Title' instead	
	of 'Main title'
